# CSA Slack Bot
> Used Slack app example from ðŸ“š [Getting started with Bolt for JavaScript tutorial][1] as a baseline

> Used plugin router created by Max Kaparawich from the [Hack4Impact Slack Bot][2]

> Created with Bolt, deployed with [Serverless and AWS Lambda][3]

## Overview

This is a Slack app built with the Bolt for JavaScript framework that is planned to have a [donut date pairing feature][4] 
and a member participation and tracking feature [using Airtable][5] for the rest of CSA board to use

## Contributing

Look at the issues tab and assign yourself one. We will use Zenhub for project management, so you can go to the Zenhub tab too if you have that installed.

To complete issues, make a branch off of main using this format for branch name:
```
[your-first-name]/[issue-#]/[slug]
```
do whatever it is the issue tells you to do, and create a PR.

Code will be checked for syntactical issues, but CD is set up, meaning new code is automatically deployed to AWS Lambda and changes will be reflected in the live slack bot
